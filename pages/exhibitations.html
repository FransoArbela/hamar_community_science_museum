                <p>Discover our thoughtfully designed exhibition spaces that celebrate art, culture, and history. Our
                    museum offers a
                    variety of galleries, each tailored to create immersive experiences that connect visitors with the
                    stories behind the
                    exhibits.</p>

                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night
                    sky and what we can
                    see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that
                    can be seen and
                    learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
                    Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the
                    latest exploration
                    of the planets in our solar system.</p>

                <h1>Evolution</h1>
                <img src="/img/skeleton.jpg" alt="skeleton">
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do
                    we come from and how
                    did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring
                    and understanding
                    our place in this world.</p>
                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time.
                    You can also take
                    some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
                    Dodos, and a number of
                    dinosaurs too.</p>

                <h1>Biology and Medicine</h1>
                <img src="/img/samuel-zeller-113381.jpg" alt="image of a human doll showing organs">
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                    insights into the great
                    wonders of the tiny world.</p>
                <p>For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks
                    to the growth of
                    our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take
                    a look at some
                    major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.</p>
                <p>
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing
                    animals in the wild.
                    Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the
                    future. From useful
                    home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say hello
                    and shake the hand of
                    Rob the Robot.</p>

                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                    becomes that scientists
                    explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.</p>
                <p>In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global
                    warming, extinction of
                    species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter
                    future.</p>

                    Technology will be
                    delivering 3 lectures on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this exciting

                <h2>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h2>
                <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the
                    Community Science Museum.
                    It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we
                    harness them. From
                    solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
                    wind to create
                    power.</p>
