                <h1>Hamar Community Science Museum</h1>
                <p>Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to
                    all.

                    The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our
                    discoveries and perhaps even
                    ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.
                    This is why we have
                    over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these
                    exhibits are designed for
                    you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits –
                    they only come to
                    life at night when everyone’s gone home).

                <p>We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where
                    you’ll get to
                    explore and experiment with our team of experts.
                    During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age
                    to go on a journey of
                    discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and
                    how you can join,
                    send us a message.</p>
